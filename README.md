# NPC Terminal

Introducing NPC terminal, a windows Terminal clone but better!

To add custom commands go to the CustomCommmands.cs file and add your command into the dictionary as well as a function for it. Inside the actual function you can create the logic and also write to the terminal console using the Append() function which adds text onto there with any color you want!

Video coming soon. Please ignore this repo if you don't want spoilers.
